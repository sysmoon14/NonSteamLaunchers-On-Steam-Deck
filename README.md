NonSteamLaunchers 🚀
</h1>

This script installs the latest GE-Proton, installs NonSteamLaunchers under one unique Proton prefix folder in your compatdata folder path called "NonSteamLaunchers" and adds them to your Steam Library. It will also add the games automatically on every steam restart.
So you can use them on Desktop or in Game Mode.

<h1 align="center">
Features  ✅
</h1>

- Automatic installation of the most popular launchers in your Steam Deck 🎮
- Handle automatically the download and installation of your chosen launchers and the games ⌚️ 
- MicroSD Support 💾 This script supports moving the entire prefix to a microSD. The script will install launchers and games to your SD card, and the launchers in Steam will point to the SD card installation. This allows you to save internal storage space on your Steam Deck!

<!--- Thanks https://github.com/Heus-Sueh -->

* Go to desktop mode, right click the download button above and save the .desktop file to your Steam Deck desktop. 
* Go to your desktop, click the NonSteamLaunchers icon, it will download and run the latest NonSteamLaunchers.sh from this repository and run it.
* You will simply have to choose which launcher to install and let the script handle the rest. 💻 No files are left in your "Downloads" they are deleted after installation.
* After running the script, launch Steam on your Steam Deck. You'll find the new launchers in your library under the non-steam tab. Click a launcher to see your installed games from that store, and launch them directly from Steam! If you have downloaded a game inside of your launcher, restart your deck or steam adn the NSLGameScanner.service should add it to your library. Even in gamemode 🥳

<!--- TODO: handful of broken icons (cf. 🡺🡺🡺 ); probably should remove or replace them with more common font to handle unicode-->

## Development Environment

### Dev Container

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Once installed, a clean dev environment with a Docker container [native to VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_dockerfile) is spun up automatically. 

* [Command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (⇧⌘P) > Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
* F5 for debug
    * May need to select interpreter (e.g., `/opt/venv/bin/python`) first

**VSCode Extensions (Dev Container)**

### Manual Docker Instance

If VSCode isn't present or only the python portion (cf. `__init__.py`) is being worked on, it's possible to just run a Docker container on its own. The container installs the correct version of python and any dependencies (e.g., ipython, rich) in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
# navigate to directory with Dockerfile
cd .devcontainer/

# build image
docker build -t nonsteamlaunchers .

# run container
docker run -it --rm --name=mynonsteamlaunchers --workdir=/app -v $(pwd):/app nonsteamlaunchers bash

# exit container
exit
```

### Python virtual environment

Useful for the python module(s), but extra compared to the [dev container](#dev-container) portion that covers the core shell script.

```bash
# create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Additional tooling

Additional tooling includes but is not limited to:

#### asdf

* Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_2-download-asdf)
* Usage
    ```bash
    # add python plugin
    asdf plugin-add python

    # install stable python
    asdf install python <latest|3.11.4>

    # set stable to system python
    asdf global python latest

    # add poetry asdf plugin
    asdf plugin-add poetry https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-poetry.git

    # install latest version via asdf
    asdf install poetry <latest|1.5.1>

    # set latest version as default
    asdf global poetry latest
    ```

#### shellcheck

`.shellcheckrc` excludes various [bash language rules](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Ignore#ignoring-one-or-more-types-of-errors-forever). Useful to control noise vs. legitimate warnings/errors when using the shellcheck extension.
